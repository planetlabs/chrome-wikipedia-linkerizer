== Wikipedia Linkerizer!

Takes Lat/Long links in Wikipedia, and turns them into Lat/Long (N scenes) links with an accurate scenes count and a link to the Planet scenes app!

To install without using the Chrome store, download [this repository](https://github.com/planetlabs/chrome-wikipedia-linkerizer/archive/master.zip) and extract it somewhere you won't forget about it. Then go to chrome://extensions and turn on "Developer mode", "Load unpacked extension..." and load it from the "plugin" directory. You should be good to go!
